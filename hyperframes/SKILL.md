description: Create video compositions, animations, title cards, overlays, captions, voiceovers, audio-reactive visuals, and scene transitions in HyperFrames HTML. Use when asked to build any HTML-based video content, add captions or subtitles synced to audio, generate text-to-speech narration, create audio-reactive animation (beat sync, glow, pulse driven by music), add animated text highlighting (marker sweeps, hand-drawn circles, burst lines, scribble, sketchout), or add transitions between scenes (crossfades, wipes, reveals, shader transitions). Covers composition authoring, timing, media, and the full video production workflow. For dev-loop CLI commands (init, lint, inspect, preview, render) see the hyperframes-cli skill; for asset preprocessing commands (tts, transcribe, remove-background) see the hyperframes-media skill.

# HyperFrames

HTML is the source of truth for video. A composition is an HTML file with `data-*` attributes for timing, a GSAP timeline for animation, and CSS for appearance. The framework handles clip visibility, media playback, and timeline sync.

## Approach

### Discovery (exploratory requests only)

For open-ended requests ("make me a product launch video", "create something for our brand") where the user hasn't committed to a direction, understand intent before picking colors:

- **Audience** — who watches this? Developers? Executives? General consumers?
- **Platform** — where does it play? Social (15s), website hero, product demo, internal?
- **Priority** — what matters most? Motion quality? Content accuracy? Brand fidelity? Speed?
- **Variations** — does the user want options, or a single best shot?

For specific requests ("add a title card", "fix the timing on scene 3"), skip discovery.

For exploratory requests, consider offering 2-3 variations that differ meaningfully — not just color swaps, but different pacing, energy levels, or structural approaches. One safe/expected, one ambitious. Don't mandate this — it's a tool available when appropriate.

### Step 1: Design system

If a design spec exists in the project, read it first. Look in precedence order: `frame.md` → `design.md` → `DESIGN.md`. `frame.md` is the preferred spec for video/hyperframes projects and wins if more than one exists; it uses the same format as `design.md`. It's the source of truth for brand colors, fonts, and constraints. Use its exact values — don't invent colors or substitute fonts.

If no `frame.md` or `design.md` exists, ask: mood, light or dark, any brand colors/fonts?

**The design spec defines the brand. It does not define video composition rules.**

### Step 2: Prompt expansion

Always run on every composition (except single-scene pieces and trivial edits). This step grounds the user's intent against the design spec and produces a consistent intermediate.

### Step 3: Plan

Before writing HTML, think at a high level:

1. **What** — what should the viewer experience? Identify the narrative arc, key moments, and emotional beats.
2. **Structure** — how many compositions, which are sub-compositions vs inline, what tracks carry what (video, audio, overlays, captions).
3. **Rhythm** — declare your scene rhythm before implementing. Which scenes are quick hits, which are holds, where do shaders land, where does energy peak.
4. **Timing** — which clips drive the duration, where do transitions land, what's the pacing.
5. **Layout** — build the end-state first. See "Layout Before Animation" below.
6. **Animate** — then add motion using the rules below.

**Build what was asked.** Every scene, every element, every tween should earn its place.

## Layout Before Animation

Position every element where it should be at its **most visible moment** — the frame where it's fully entered, correctly placed, and not yet exiting. Write this as static HTML+CSS first. No GSAP yet.

### The process

1. **Identify the hero frame** for each scene — the moment when the most elements are simultaneously visible.
2. **Write static CSS** for that frame. The `.scene-content` container MUST fill the full scene using `width: 100%; height: 100%; padding: Npx;` with `display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: Npx; box-sizing: border-box`.
3. **Add entrances with `gsap.from()`** — animate FROM offscreen/invisible TO the CSS position.
4. **Add exits with `gsap.to()`** — animate TO offscreen/invisible FROM the CSS position.

### Example

```css
.scene-content {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  padding: 120px 160px;
  gap: 24px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

```js
// Animate INTO positions
tl.from(".title", { y: 60, opacity: 0, duration: 0.6, ease: "power3.out" }, 0);
tl.from(".subtitle", { y: 40, opacity: 0, duration: 0.5, ease: "power3.out" }, 0.2);

// Animate OUT from positions
tl.to(".title", { y: -40, opacity: 0, duration: 0.4, ease: "power2.in" }, 3);
tl.to(".subtitle", { y: -30, opacity: 0, duration: 0.3, ease: "power2.in" }, 3.1);
```
